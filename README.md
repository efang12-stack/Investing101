Alpha Finance App

This is a financial literacy application created by me utilizing JSON parsing, Swift, and SwiftUI. Here are the UI design pages for the application below to display the videos and articles made by students at my school:

By implementing a backend service called Firebase to my application, I am able to store the videos and articles in the app and display them for user app usage. The videos are synced with a Youtube channel that has finance videos uploaded weekly.
